# Stack

Create a Stack with two methods push and pop. Use your LinkedList class to keep track of the elements internally.

## Example

This is an example of a test case:

    stack = Stack.new
    stack.push(3)
    stack.push(5)
    puts stack.pop
    # => 5

    stack.push(2)
    stack.push(7)
    puts stack.pop
    # => 7

    puts stack.pop
    # => 2

    puts stack.pop
    # => 3
