# Challenge

The method sqrt takes in one square number. 

Fill the method `sqrt_recursive` that returns the square root of a given number.
Do not use any built in methods for calculating the square-root and don't try searching through all the numbers. Instead, use a binary-style search to home in on the actual square root. 
(To make it simpler, the input will just contain square numbers.)

## Examples

    puts sqrt(25)
    # => 5

    puts sqrt(7056)
    # => 84
